# Stock_Market_Analysis
Description of the Project: The investigation delves into the impact of fundamental analysis on the movement of stock market data. A list of machine learning algorithms used and compared to discover the best method for the feature selection are the Chi-squared method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Logistic Regression, LightGBM Model, XGBoost Model, Genetic Algorithm, Select K Best Method, Lasso Method, Tree based model, and Cuckoo Search Optimization. The number of features retained is 75 out of 220, with an accuracy of 99.90% for the LightGBM model. Finally, I performed Hyperparameter tuning on the data before diagramming its data flows. In the realm of fundamental analysis, the CatBoost model demonstrated a peak accuracy of 99.80% following k-fold cross-validation, surpassing the performance of the Random Forest Model, Support Vector Classification, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The study also comprehensively explores the capabilities and impact of sentiment analysis and its various forms.
